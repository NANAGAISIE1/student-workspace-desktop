      "This study examines the relationship between social media use and mental health outcomes among teenagers aged 13-18. Through a mixed-methods approach involving surveys and in-depth interviews, we found a significant correlation between excessive social media use and increased symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, the study also revealed potential positive effects of social media, such as increased social support and access to mental health resources. These findings highlight the complex nature of social media's impact on teenage mental health and suggest the need for balanced approaches in addressing this issue.",
